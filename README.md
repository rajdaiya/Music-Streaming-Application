# MyMusic
MyMusic is a database-backed website for an online music streaming service similar to Spotify where users are able to play tracks, create playlists, like an artist, rate songs, follow other users, and browse and search for music. A user dashboard has been designed which is customized for every registered user. This dashboard generates new tracks by artists they like, new playlists from people they follow or containing artists they like, etc. Appropriate measures to guard against SQL injection and cross-site scripting attacks have also been taken care of.
